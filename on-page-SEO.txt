[MUSIC] Welcome to the module,
Advanced On-Page SEO. Last week we learned about
the importance of keyword research and how to evaluate our competition. This week, armed with those skills, let's
explore the realms of audience analysis, competitive content analysis and
how to perform an internal content audit. But our major emphasis this week will
be in the areas of the main level content strategy to increase
visibility and creating great content. We'll take a look at the factors that
contribute to successful strategies and examine the elements
that make content great. A carefully crafted strategy will
lead audiences to the site, but great content will prompt action and
help business meet their goals. By the end of this module,
you will be prepared to analyze content, design an effective strategy, and
develop great content for your site. There's a lot to cover this week,
so let's get started. [MUSIC]
